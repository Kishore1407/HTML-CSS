# Simple Booking Interface - Frontend Mentor Solution

This is my solution to the **Simple Booking Interface** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). The goal was to build a responsive UI for a dog-walking chat interface using only HTML and CSS.

## 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Creating linear gradient backgrounds and soft UI card shadows
- Structuring chat interfaces with `flexbox`
- Building responsive layouts for both desktop and mobile
- Styling buttons as perfect circles using only CSS

Example:
```css
.chat-input button {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: hsl(271, 36%, 24%);
  color: white;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Add interaction (JS) for input and chat messages
- Improve accessibility with ARIA labels
- Optimize layout for larger screens and tablets
